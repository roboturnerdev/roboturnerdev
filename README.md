### About Me:
I learned to program while studying Game Programming at Full Sail University in 2009-2011. After that, my career was mainly focused on Finance as a Personal Banker and also as a Title IV Student Aid Administrator at a vocational college.

My passion for tech has only grown in the last 2-3 years. I would consider myself mostly self-taught, having taken several online courses including two Web Developer Bootcamps on Udemy, SQL, DSA, and more. I have made small side projects with friends, and dreamed about more. Now, I've made the decision to make the career move and become the develoepr I always dreamed of becoming.
   
Any and all questions are much appreciated. I value feedback and would also love to chat about any career opportunities. If you have space on your team for a charismatic, excited, leader-from-within professional who is eager to learn and grow -- you've got my contact.
